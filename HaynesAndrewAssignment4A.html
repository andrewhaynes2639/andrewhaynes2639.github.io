			<p>-Why is weather observing important?-<br>
Weather observing is important because it provides both climatology (the study of weather conditions at a certain location over time) and provides our customers (mostly pilots) with any weather restrictions to their missions. 
For example, if we know that a certain set of mountain peaks in the distance are at 2500FT and there are clouds hugging the top of them, aircraft will not be able to fly in that area. However, if we notice that the conditions are improving in that area, we can alert the pilots and they can resume operations. <br>

-How do you observe weather?-<br>
Weather observations are completed by looking at the following fields: winds, visibility, ceilings, temperature, dew point, and altimeter. It is important to provide all of these fields because collectively they are used during aircraft takeoff, landing, and also while flying. If conducted carelessly, they can significantly impact the route-of-flight of an aircraft causing wasted money and possibly putting lives in danger. <br><br>
Winds – The wind field includes both wind direction and speed. Speeds are measured in knots. Wind gusts are also incorporated. <br>
Visiblity – Visiblity is most important for aircraft during landing. If they cannot see the ground during landing there is a potential that they could miscalculate the distance and hit the ground with too much force, and damaging the aircraft. This also is critical to combat operations where they need to see a target.  <br>
Ceilings – Ceilings are the amount of clouds in the sky. If it is fairly clear outside, there are no ceilings, but if you cannot see blue at all than there is a ceiling. This could force pilots to fly much lower than they would like to and especially makes a difference in mountainous terrain where the possibility of crashing increases if you fly too low. <br>
Temperature/Dew Point – Most people know what these two values are. However, they serve a big purpose for aircraft. If temperatures are too low, water could freeze on the aircraft rotors and propellers causing increased drag. Ultimately this makes the aircraft heavier and does not allow it to fly, which could cause it to fall from the sky. This is also helpful if temperatures get too hot, which could damage internal components of the aircraft. <br>
Altimeter – Altimeter is a major help during both takeoff and landing. The pilots must set their altimeter during takeoff, which lets them know what altitude they are flying at, and also tells them where the ground is during landing.
