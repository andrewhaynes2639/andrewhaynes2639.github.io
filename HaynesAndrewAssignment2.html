			<h3 class="numhead">1. Download the App</h3>
			<p class="textbox">In order to use the SoloLearn app you much first download it. For me, this is done through the Google Play store. If you navigate to apps and then enter SoloLearn in the search box it should return the app in the search results. Once you have found the SoloLearn app, you can install it by clicking the install button (the green button on the right side of the page where mine states “Installed.” While the app is being installed you can get motivated to learn some new languages!</p>

			<h3 class="numhead">2. Select a Course to Take</h3>
			<p class="textbox">Once the app has installed on your device you will be able to select the languages you would like to learn. In today’s world it is imperative that those in an IT field are familiar with many different types of languages. This will allow a more flexible and more successful career and give you the ability to crush any challenge that stands in your way. This will also allow you to nail an interview with that fortune 500 company you want to work for. By showing knowledge, experience, and willingness as a go-getter, you show your boss that you can accept any project that you’re tasked with. In SoloLearn you can learn many languages to include: CSS, HTML, SQL, JavaScript, C++, Python 3, C#, jQuery, PHP, Java, Swift, and Ruby.</p>

			<h3 class="numhead">3. Review Learning Roadmap</h3>
			<p class="textbox">Reviewing the learning roadmap will lay the foundation for your learning. It will begin with an overview of the course, stating any definitions that you may not understand. It also talks about what you use the language for and what you can do with it. You will then progress onto some basics of that language with both question and answer type training along with hands-on training using their “Code Playground”. This “Playground” uses a real-time visualization of the code you are manipulating and really helps users learn how changes affect their end-state product. This progresses from beginner-type training to more advanced functions. Also, if you are already experienced with that language, you can take a test to skip the more beginner lessons. </p>

		<div class="text">
			<h3 class="numhead">4. Explore Various Techniques and Features of that Language</h3>
			<p class="textbox">Each language has its own set of modules that are used to test your ability to remember key terms, and also challenge your ability to properly code items on your own. This way of training really helps users to learn the language, while utilizing them just like they would in the workplace. For the HTML course, it progresses similar to the WEBD121 course where you learn the structure of a webpage, then learn the elements of a webpage, and then build upon your ability by introducing audio and video elements. These modules are a great learning tool, but what’s better is that you also have the ability to refer to these in the future, even after successful completion of the course. </p>

			<p class="textbox">Once you have completed all requirements for the course, you will receive a certificate for your hard work. It does not come easy and requires countless hours and dedication to each course. However, if you’re a nerd like me and enjoy learning some new languages in your free time, this is the app for you! I hope this inspires you to download the SoloLearn app and start using it today!</p>
