		<p>FE Warren, or Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, was not only my first duty location, but is also Wyoming’s most haunted location. The base was first an Army Post from 1867 to 1947 when the Air Force took it over and now hosts the AF’s ICBM (Inter-continental ballistic missile) program. <br><br>
		However, FE Warren is home to quite a few ghost stories and hauntings. One ghost sighting is of a cavalryman known to patrol the base at night. 
		A ghost names Jeffrey, roams the ICBM museum on base, sometimes disabling the security alarms. There was once a working elevator in the museum, however it has been shut down because it has left passengers stranded several times. Maintenance workers still have not been able to figure out why this happens and state that there are no mechanical reasons. <br><br>
		Another ghost sighting occurs at the camping area, where visitors hear sounds of a woman screaming. This is said to be the location of a once ghastly massacre between soldiers and a Native American woman. <br><br>
		There are also buildings, such as the Security Forces building (which used to be the hospital) that are considered most haunted. The K9 working dogs refuse to enter the second floor of that building as well as the tunnel that once lead to the morgue. <br><br>
		Creepy right?
